# Archive - Alternative Deployment Options

This folder contains deployment guides for platforms other than Railway.

## Files

- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration (if you want to use Vercel for frontend)
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed Vercel deployment guide
- `QUICK_VERCEL_DEPLOY.md` - Quick Vercel reference

## Note

These files are kept as alternatives. The primary deployment method is **Railway** (see `docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md`).

If you want to use Vercel instead:
1. Move `vercel.json` back to `frontend/`
2. Follow the guides in this folder
